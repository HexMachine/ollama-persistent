- Both `/quit` and `/goodbye` now available for user preference

#### 2. **Cursor Navigation & Input Enhancement**

- **✅ Text Editing**: Edit text at any position using arrow keys and backspace

- **✅ Live Generation**: See AI responses appear as they're generated
- **✅ Immediate Feedback**: No more waiting for complete response
- **✅ Natural Flow**: More conversational experience
- **✅ Progress Indication**: Visual feedback during generation

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Enhanced Input Handling
```python
# Before: Basic input() - no cursor movement
user_input = input("You: ")

# After: readline-enhanced input with full editing
import readline  # Enables arrow keys, history, editing
user_input = input("You: ")  # Now supports cursor navigation
```

#### Streaming API Integration
```python
# Before: Wait for complete response
response = ollama.chat(model, messages, stream=False)
print(response['message']['content'])

# After: Stream tokens as generated  
stream = ollama.chat(model, messages, stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)
```

#### Command Enhancement
```python
# Before: Only /quit
if user_input.lower() == '/quit':
    print("Goodbye! Your chat history has been saved.")

# After: Multiple exit options
if user_input.lower() in ['/quit', '/goodbye']:
    if user_input.lower() == '/goodbye':
        print("Goodbye! Thank you for chatting. Your conversation history has been preserved for next time. 👋")
    else:
        print("Goodbye! Your chat history has been saved.")
```
